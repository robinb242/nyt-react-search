## NYT-React-Search
This app scrapes the New York Times website for news stories. User can choose a search topic and a range of publication dates. User can also save articles of interest to read later. This app was developed using React.

## Executing App 

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for examination. This app assumes that you have Node.js and MongoDB installed and ready to go on your system. Navigate to the root directory and do the following.

1. Install dependencies
2. In your CLI, enter **mongod**
3. Open a second CLI window, go to root and enter **yarn start**.

Your browser should automatically open a new tab containing the app.

These node modules are requireed to run the program.

1. express
2. mongoose
3. body-parser
4. bluebird
5. axios
6. react
7. react-dom
8. react-router-dom
9. react-scripts

Since I have included two package.json files, you do not need to install dependencies by name. Simply run "npm install" from the root directory, and then cd to the 'client' directory and npm install again. All the necessary modules should be installed automatically.
